# :computer: About the Page

The MeCademy WebApp allows people to get information about MeCademy, learn about the program and the coaches, as well as read testimonials, register for the program via typeform and of course get into contact by mail or social media.

##  :question: MeCademy

MeCademy is an online academy that brings back female academics to a career within 2 months. Since MeCademy is certified by the German job center, female academics could get a voucher to join the 8 weeks program for free.

-  Week 3: Create your CV that presents you at best
-  Week 4: Write a cover letter to distinct from others
-  Week 5: Learn the 3 most important facts and train your job interview
-  Week 6: Get hints for your negotiation and train your salary negotiation
-  Week 7 & 8: Position as expert with personal branding
