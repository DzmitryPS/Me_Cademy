### About us	
We are [Dzmitry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dzmitryps/), [Viet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viet-quoc-pham-2850581ba/), [Nadine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadinestrobel/) and [Carlos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosaore/), four students of the [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/) **remote** class from around the world who teamed up for this project.\
At the moment these lines are being written, we are finishing a ["Web developer"](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/en-GB/trainings/web-developer-full-time) Bootcamp that is 5 months long and is teaching us all the technical know-how and knowledge to develop interactive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, so we can take a React and Node JS development project to completion.

### Why did we create this?
This is the final project of our 5 months bootcamp at [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/) as well as our first project with a real client.

>*Thanks for the amazing collaboration Karin & Eliz!*
